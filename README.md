Full-Stack Web Application with React, NodeJS/Express, and MongoDB

This project, completed as part of the LOG2440 course, is a full-stack web application that uses React for the client-side and NodeJS/Express for the server-side. The application is backed by a MongoDB database for data persistence.

The project includes two separate applications: a ReactJS client-side application and a NodeJS/Express server-side application. The server-side application includes controllers, services, and default data, while the React application includes components and pages.

To deploy the application, you will need to configure an instance of MongoDB using the Cloud Atlas service, install NodeJS and npm, and run the necessary commands to install the required libraries.

Once the application is deployed, you can run the included unit tests using Jest to ensure that the application is working correctly. The project also includes a list of initial songs, which can be expanded upon by adding additional songs and updating the songs.json file.

Overall, this project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack web development using advanced technologies and tools.
